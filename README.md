# AI Saturdays Lagos Research Cohort 2
# Introduction
Our one-month Research Cohort this November runs over five Saturday and it is open to anyone interested in research. Our audience encompases individuals that wants to learn how to effectively read, present, and extend technical research papers.

The cohort will provide an opportunity to:
- Learn how to critically read and analyze research papers.
- Present research findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Re-implement or extend a selected research paper.
- Interact with seasoned researchers from academia, industry and research institutes 

While all applicants are invited to participate in discussions, give feedback, and attend the presentations, 10 research scholars are selected to present their chosen papers and demonstrate an extension or re-implementation of the work.
